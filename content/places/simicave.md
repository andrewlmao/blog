## Rocky Peak Trailhead
1. Take exit 32 (Rocky Peak Road) on the Ronald Reagan Freeway (CA-118)
2. Take a left and park in the parking space. There are limited amount of spaces, so if the parking lot is filled up, then take a right and park in that space.

## Comments
1. The cave is smaller than I thought it would be.
2. Once you arrive, you need to go downwards and use the wires on the rock to lower yourself. Don't go upwards and scale the rock.
3. The graffiti is beautiful.
4. Don't go on the weekends, as it may be crowded and you will be unable to go inside the cave.
5. Don't get lost. We ended up having to walk all the way down Hummingbird Trail, then along the highway to get back to the trailhead.
