## TLDR;
In 2009, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a new mission statement for the social media platform to reflect their goal to ["make the world more open connected"](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/bring-the-world-closer-together/). Social media was marketed as a way to foster unity and build a sense of community, but as the Internet has proliferated and become a ubiquitous part of everyday lives for 7 in 10 of Americans and billions [^1] of people around the globe, it has instead done the opposite, making us more polarized and isolated as a nation and as a world.
- social media brings into question the extent to which adopting technology is good and actually beneficial?
- whenever we adopt new technology, we have to take a second and think about the balance between convenience/individual rights and if it actually benefits us in the bigger picture and as a society

## Isolation
- instead of face to face interactions, people just text/send pictures to eachother, there is no substance in interactions, and the hyperconnectivity means that both good/bad information spreads quickly 

## Censorship

We often fail to recognize the things we willingly give up as we mindlessly scroll through our algorithmically generated feeds: aside from [destroying our attention spans](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/attention-span-focus-screens-apps-smartphones-social-media), we have voluntarily forfeited our ability to think independently and clearly, to make rational decisions, and to maintain our privacy. Social media companies have accrued an alarming amount of power through their handling of massive influxes of user data, and this power has been abused to manipulate how social media users think and act.
- instead of exploiting our attention to keep us scrolling (heal out attention spans)
- switch-cost effect --> every time we look at our phone we lose that time + time it takes to refocus
	- borrows ideas from economics
- social media is a constant distraction, real-time aspect of social media (posts per minute), constant sharing, likes, posts, tweets
	- constantly pinging us with notifications
- context switching is a drag on productivity

Private corporations have considerable power over what content is posted on their platforms. Social media had started as a bastion of free speech where people could speek their minds freely, but this policy exposed inherent problems within the social media system. Free speech is a double edged sword: good content is just easily as posted bad content, and speech that attacked people for their beliefs, race, etc...  and content that spread falsities and lies easily proliferated on social media networks. Extremes on both aisles of the political spectrum have exploited this characteristic (And this isn't just a one sided thing: take the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation and Q Anon conspiracy as examples) which has led to irrational and rash analysis of situations. The extremist minority of America have hijacked social media and have gained a disproportionate amount of influence on the Internet. The easy sharing of sensationalist content and articles without close analysis or critical thinking from social media users has only led to more confirmation bias, and giving people what they want to hear has hindered people from venturing beyond their comfort zone and exploring new ideas. People like short tweets and don't care to investigate further, and politicians promise seemingly easy solutions to issues that have more nuance. People who are moderates feel inclined to agree with either radical viewpoint.

Under significant pressure, social media companies have now taken on the responsibility of monitoring what content is posted on their platform. The fact that a few individuals within a social media company decide whether or not users have access to an important platform for speech is an inherently [problematic](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension) centralization of power. There were no courts/application of the law applied, but rather the use of a company's subjective policies.Considering the scope and influence of the platforms, social media has given these individuals power to successfully censor what they "feel" is not acceptable, allowing drawing arbitrary standards to fit their agenda. This censorship has allowed companies to control how people think and act, creating an artificial sense of unity. Silencing dissent is problematic: it promotes a confined society where you can only think and act a particular way. Instead, as former Justice Louis Brandeis once said about his counterspeech doctrine that we need "more speech, not enforced silence". People need to relearn to listen to what others are saying and realize the merits of the argument on both sides, even if offensive or unsettling. Social media perpetuates the lack of understanding between the two dominant political ideologies in America. People are willing to spread their own ideas, but feel the need to shutdown other ideas that make them uncomfortable. As soon as free speech extends to people they don't agree with, they feel the right to shut it down. This behaviour goes against the ideals of a democratic society. Social media has also promoted cancel culture/ochlocracy by giving people the power to "cancel" individuals that go against their ideals. The survival of democracy hinges on an educated population. Social media promotes ignorance and is a threat to democracy and freedom. As more local issues are thrown into the national spotlight, extreme polarization and lack of compromise is simply unsustainable in our republican form of government. We need more civil discourse and more open-minded people who are willing to listen to opposing ideas and make informed decisions.

## Mental Health
Social media now ultimately serves as a giant positive feedback loop that reaffirms our beliefs and promotes confirmation bias. Targeted advertisements now dominate social media sites, where companies collect and sell user data to advertising firms for a substantial profit. Social media companies best interests are in their pockets, not in their users.

The hyperconnectedness created by social media has also cultivated an unhealthy mindset: users are given the illusion that other people are living their best lives and that their current lives are somehow inadequate. The constant nagging feeling of not being enough had deteriorated the mental health and led to [feelings of low self-esteem](https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20201005/social-media-use-may-play-important-role-in-youth-suicide-expert-says). Social media has made us feel the need to compare ourselves to one another and constantly search for validation, when we should instead focus on what we think of ourselves and what makes us happy as individuals.

Social media has also set unrealistic standards for young women in terms of body image and acceptable behavior, a problem exacerbated by the increase in online cyberbullying. The quasi-anonymity provided by social media has emboldened people to say what they would never say in public. Small scale social media could be beneficial, but the wide scope of the internet has made it unsustainable for mental health and wellbeing of society. 
- solution is not to abstain from social media but "we need to press reset on the technology that underpins our working day so it creates focus, not chaos"
	- focus on promoting digital minimalism --> cut down on the amount of apps that we use
	- we work best when deeply immersed in something challenging 
	- modern social media impedes are ability to reach a flow state and a good workflow
- what we need to do is live within the limits of what our brain can actually handle, one task at a time: taking 9 and a half minutes on average to get back into a good workflow when they switched apps[^2]
