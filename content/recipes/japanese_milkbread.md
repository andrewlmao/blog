## Notes
- **tangzhong** is responsible for the light, fluffy texture in Asian bakery
	- good base for sandwiches and toasts
## Tangzhong
- a roux with flour and water
- warming to activate the gluten in the flour before even mixing with other ingredients
### Instructions
1. Make some tangzhong slightly ahead
2. Put 2 tablespoons of bread flour and 6 tablespoons of water in small pan. Mix until smooth and no lumps remain-before turning on the heat
3. Warm the flour gently over medium-low heat until it thickens, stirring constantly. Look for trails left behind.

## Milkbread
1. Measure out 300g of breadflour or ~2 cups, 2 teaspoons of yeast, 1/2 cup of milk (lukewarm), ~2tbsp of butter (melted), 1 teaspoon of salt, 3 tablespoon of sugar, 1 egg. Put all into a large bowl. Add the cooled tanzhong to the egg and mix together. Mix well, then knead. Add more flour if needed.
2. Once dough is no longer sticky, transfered to another bowl and let rise for ~1 hour.
3. Once risen, punch back the dough. Divide dough into three pieces. 
4. Roll one piece into an oval, then fold the other side on top to form three layers. Gently roll up the piece of dough.
5. Repeat with other pieces of dough. Place in oiled loaf pan.
6. Cover and let rise again until loaf is reaching top of the pan. Cover top with egg wash.
7. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the loaf for ~30 minutes until golden brown. If it browns too fast, then tent with foil. Put on cooling rack to cool.
