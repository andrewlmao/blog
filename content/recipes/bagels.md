## Directions
### Bagels
1. Bloom your yeast first. Get 297 grams of water at about 100 degrees F and add 10 grams of yeast (~ 1 tablespoon) and 23 grams of sugar (~1.5 tablespoon).
2. Give a stir to immerse yeast in water. Let it rest for 10 minutes. The yeast will puff up. Stir again.
3. Add 500g (~3.5 cups) bread flour, 6g salt (~1.5 teaspoons)and the yeast to a bowl. 
4. Turn dough out onto work surface(or in the bowl, if large enough) and knead the dough for ~10 minutes.
5. Fold the bottom sides into itself and roll on surface to form a boule.
6. Put in oiled bowl. Roll around so the dough does not stick to the bottom. Let the dough rise for one hour.
7. Punch down the dough. Divide into eight equal pieces. 
8. Shape each piece into a perfect little ball. Folding sides up and into itself. On a non flour surface, swirl the seam side to smooth out (constant contact). Rest dough for 10 minutes.
9. Take one of the balls and press floured thumb and index finger through.
10. Twirl the dough around on two fingers to slowly stretch out the hole (stretch to ~1 inch)
11. Get a pot of boiling water, drop bagels into water (only a single layer) and leave room for expansion.

13. Brush each bagle with egg wash. 
14. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and bake for 20-25 minutes.
